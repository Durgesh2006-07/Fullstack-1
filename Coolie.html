    <h2> Production:-</h2>
    <h3> Development:-</h3>
    <para>During the filming of Master in late 2019, initial discussions for a collaboration between director Lokesh Kanagaraj and Rajinikanth began, when the former narrated a story to the actor at his residence in Chennai.
         The project was originally conceived as Rajinikanth's 169th film, was expected to be produced by Raaj Kamal Films International, with a planned start in April 2020.
          However, the film was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Rajinikanth's prior commitments to Annaatthe (2021).
           Around this time, Rajinikanth's political ambitions also cast uncertainty on the film's future, though Lokesh refrained from confirming whether the project had been shelved, stating in August 2020 that the decision rested with the producers.
           Instead, Lokesh went on to develop a film with Kamal Haasan, which materialised as Vikram (2022).
           Rajinikanth's 169th film ultimately became Jailer (2023), directed by Nelson Dilipkumar.<br>
           Reports of a potential collaboration between Lokesh and Rajinikanth resurfaced in April 2023, followed by a photoshoot with the actor in May.
           Actors Mysskin and Babu Antony, who had recently appeared in Lokesh's Leo (2023), later hinted at Lokesh and Rajinikanth's collaboration.
           Lokesh officially confirmed the project in July, and Sun Pictures announced the film, tentatively titled Thalaivar 171, on 11 September.
           The film marked Rajinikanth's fifth venture with Sun Pictures after Enthiran (2010), Petta (2019), Annaatthe and Jailer.
           Lokesh received ₹50 crore in remuneration for the film, double his pay for Leo, while Rajinikanth was reportedly paid ₹150 crore.
           The official title, Coolie, was revealed on 22 April 2024.Lokesh stated that the film would be a standalone story, separate from the Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU), and would focus on gold smuggling instead of drug-related themes seen in his previous films.</para>
